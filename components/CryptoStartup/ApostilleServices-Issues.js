          <p>
            In India, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MEA) 
            is the sole authority to be in charge of displaying 
            the Apostill Certificate. The MEA affects the Apostille
            stickers on the back of the original document or the 
            back of a copy of it, and checks the reliability of the document.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
           <strong ><b>Note: </b></strong>
             Before MEA apostille, some documents may 
            require state-level attestation from SDM or HRD departments.
